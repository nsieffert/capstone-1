<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

- U = "Understand"
- P = "Plan"
- E = "Execute"
- R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>
* Build a functioning e-commerce site using at least ten products with search and cart functionality.
* Bonus features list include: actual checkout; search by any word; error handling, etc...
* Learning involved: Javascript; React; Bootstrap?; React-Router; 
*
*
*
*
*
<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
* Planning and Set Up:
    * What Product do I want to sell?
    * Gather information: photos, pricing, descriptions, quantities;
    * Create file structure on local machine for files, images, data, etc...
    * Prepare GitHub - download repo and get VS Code set up.
* Design:
    * Layout website look and feel - all pages should carry over same design.
    * Layout the pages and flow;
    * Paper or wireframe to design look of site
    * List needed functionality to "make it happen"
    * Gap analysis: what do I know and what do I need to find out?
    * Lay out learning plan: critical path: required items vs bonus functionality.
<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan
</h2>
* Concurrent learning via Udemy, YouTube, Stack Overflow, etc... and wireframe design.
* Begin implementing basic design in VS Code - building the pages and functionality.
    * Home page
    * Product Page
    * Cart Page
    * About Page
    * Header
    * NavBar
* Implement CSS design as needed at this point. (more CSS later).
* Implement functionality:
    * Nav Bar - React Router
    * Search
    * Add to Cart
    * Checkout
* Clear up errors
* Implement CSS design
    * split up css files
* Final steps
    * test drive website
    * upload to github
    * pull request
    * grading form
    * evaluation
*
<h2>
    4. Reflection / Refactor
</h2>
* With more time I could implement a better search bar
* With more time I could implement a better checkout process
* Learning curve high, time to learn low;
*
